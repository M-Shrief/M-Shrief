This can be considered as a portfolio to document and upload my new projects
(models of my learning) in a more intensive & organised form. I'm aiming to Show
my learning process, workflow and on. Hoping to intensify my owned knowledge and
add to it as needed.
[You can see my Resume here](https://github.com/M-Shrief/M-Shrief/blob/main/mohamed-resume.pdf 'check Resume').

## Projects

- ["Adeeb أديب"](https://github.com/M-Shrief/M-Shrief/tree/main/adeeb_overview 'check a video preview here'),
  concerned on arabic literature: poetry and prose. It assumes a business model
  to order a specific piece of literature to be printed and delivered to
  customer, with the ability for the customer to follow up the process. All in
  TypeScript, developed with
  [Vue, Pinia and vue-router](https://github.com/M-Shrief/Adeeb_Vue_TS 'github repository for the FrontEnd'),
  [Node/Express and MongoDB](https://github.com/M-Shrief/Adeeb_ExpressTS 'github repository for the BackEnd')

### Currently working on:

- [Developing SSR front-end for "Adeeb أديب" using Quasar Framework and Vue](https://github.com/M-Shrief/Adeeb_Quasar_SSR 'github repository').
- [Migrating "Adeeb أديب" Backend to use PostgreSQL](https://github.com/M-Shrief/Adeeb_ExpressTS_Postgres 'github repository').

## Current skills:

- JavaScript (ES5, ES6)
- TypeScript
- VueJS + (Pinia and vue-router)
- NodeJS and Express.JS
- Used MySQL and MongoDB.
- CSS, SCSS and TailwindCSS (For tailwind, I know how to use it but I don't
  really like to use it)
- I'd an experience deploying with Docker

### Working to add:

- solid ground on Algorithms and Data Structures
- Unit/Component/E2E Testing using Cypress and Jest
- Deep dive in Database (PostgreSQL as a choice).
- Using SSR in frontend.
- Basic knowledge about Architecture and Design
- Docker

# Learning Journey

- CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python "CS50P" 2022 (finished)
- [IBM, "DevOps, Cloud, and Agile Foundations" Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/devops-cloud-and-agile-foundations#courses 'Check on Coursera'):
  - Introduction to DevOps (Finished)
  - Introduction to Cloud Computing (Finished)
  - Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum (Coming up)

### Databases

- CMU, Intro to Database Systems(2022) (finished)
- [Prisma's Data Guide](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide) (Reached and finished
  "Data Types")
- Deep dive into PostgreSQL (had very basic steps, more to come).
- Redis (coming up)

### Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

- [Programiz - DSA](https://www.programiz.com/dsa): **reached Sorting and
  Searching Algorithms**
- CS50 lectures about [Arrays, Algorithms, Data Structures]

### not a diary

- Used Docker to host my Databases (MongoDB - MySQL), it drained the machine too
  much. can be fixed if I:
  - moved to Manjaro linux
  - changed to SSD.

### Books

- Code Complete (Reached and finished Part 4)
- Working Effectively with Legacy code (reached and finished part2, CH9)
- Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (reached and finished the
  first 40 pages)
- Grokking Algorithms
- Designing Data Intensive Application (reached and finished part1)
- JavaScript Enlightenment
- Object-Oriented JavaScript by Stoyan Stefanov
- Clean Code, finished:
  - Intro
  - Meaningful names
  - Functions
  - Comments
  - Objects and data structures
  - Unit Tests
  - Error Handling (around 10pages)
  - Boundaries (around 8 pages)

**Currently Focusing on:**

- Design Data Intensive (trying to reach as far as I can, should finish it)
- Nodejs Design Patterns (Have to finish it )

**Slowly, Re-reading and Re-thinking to get a more solid understanding**

- Code Complete
- Working Effectively with Legacy code
- Clean Code
- Grokking Algorithm (already finished)

**To look on the future _(after finishing what I started)_:**

- Refactoring Improving the Design of Existing Code
- Refatoring to Patterns
- Reactive Design Patterns

# A new phase
 I deleted all my old repositories, and I'm going to Document and upload my new Projects/Models of learning in a more intensive & organised form.
 I'd do that in a way to show my learning process, workflow and on. I mostly use Javascript(Vue), PHP (laravel) but that doesn't mean I wouldn't use 
 new languages as my learning goes on.

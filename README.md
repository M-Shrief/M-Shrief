# A new phase
 I deleted all my old repositories, and I'm going to Document and upload my new Projects/Models of learning in a more intensive & organised form.
 I'd do that in a way to show my learning process, workflow and on. I mostly use Javascript(Vue), PHP (laravel) but that doesn't mean I wouldn't use 
 new languages as my learning goes on. I'd intensify my owned knowledge and add to it as need.

### Current skills:
- Current working with VueJS/Laravel 
	(combined with InertiaJS)
- worked with Node.JS and Express.JS before
- MySQL & MongoDB
- JS and Typescript
- PHP
- CSS, SCSS and TailwindCSS
- Had an experience with deploying using Docker
 
## Current Learning:
- Code Complete
- Working Effectively with legacy Code,
- Introduction to Algorithms
- Designing Data intensive applications

# A new phase

This conidered as a portofolio to Document and upload my new Projects/Models of my learning in a more intensive & organised form. I'm aiming to Show my learning process, workflow and on. Hoping to intensify my owned knowledge and add to it as needed.

# Main project - "Adeeb أديب"

the main sample of my learning will be ["Adeeb أديب"](https://github.com/M-Shrief/M-Shrief/blob/main/Overview-%2015th%20Jan.mp4 "check a preview here to download"), concerned on arabic litereture: poetry and prose.

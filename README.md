  It's concerned with Arabic literature. It assumes a business model that
  enables you to order a specific piece of literature to be printed with
  especial colors and font. Then it'll be delivered to the customer, with the
  ability for the customer to follow up the process. And for special customers,
  it provides them with the ability to make bulk orders fast and easy. And if
  they’re willing to signup, they can review all of their past orders.
